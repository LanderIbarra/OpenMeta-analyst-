_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Use direct plug-in methodology to select the bandwidth of a kernel
     density estimate.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dpik(x, scalest = "minim", level = 2L, kernel = "normal",   
          canonical = FALSE, gridsize = 401L, range.x = range(x), 
          truncate = TRUE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: vector containing the sample on which the kernel density
          estimate is to be constructed. 

 scalest: estimate of scale.

          '"stdev"' - standard deviation is used.

          '"iqr"' - inter-quartile range divided by 1.349 is used.

          '"minim"' - minimum of '"stdev"' and '"iqr"' is used. 

   level: number of levels of functional estimation used in the plug-in
          rule. 

  kernel: character string which determines the smoothing kernel.
          'kernel' can be: '"normal"' - the Gaussian density function
          (the default). '"box"' - a rectangular box. '"epanech"' - the
          centred beta(2,2) density. '"biweight"' - the centred
          beta(3,3) density. '"triweight"' - the centred beta(4,4)
          density. This can be abbreviated to any unique abbreviation. 

canonical: logical flag: if 'TRUE', canonically scaled kernels are used 

gridsize: the number of equally-spaced points over which binning is 
          performed to obtain kernel functional approximation.  

 range.x: vector containing the minimum and maximum values of 'x' at
          which to compute the estimate. The default is the minimum and
          maximum data values. 

truncate: logical flag: if 'TRUE', data with 'x' values outside the
          range specified by 'range.x' are ignored. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The direct plug-in approach, where unknown functionals that appear
     in expressions for the asymptotically optimal bandwidths are
     replaced by kernel estimates, is used. The normal distribution is
     used to provide an initial estimate.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     the selected bandwidth.

_B_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d:

     This method for selecting the bandwidth of a kernel density
     estimate was proposed by Sheather and Jones (1991) and is
     described in Section 3.6 of Wand and Jones (1995).

     bandwidth selection method for kernel density estimation. _Journal
     of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B_, *53*, 683-690.
