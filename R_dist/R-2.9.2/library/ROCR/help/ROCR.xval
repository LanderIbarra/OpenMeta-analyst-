_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A mock data set containing 10 sets of predictions and
     corresponding labels as would be obtained from 10-fold
     cross-validation.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     data(ROCR.xval)

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     A two element list. The first element, 'ROCR.xval$predictions', is
     itself a 10 element list. Each of these 10 elements is a vector of
     numerical predictions for each cross-validation run. Likewise, the
     second list entry, 'ROCR.xval$labels' is a 10 element list in
     which each element is a vector of true class labels corresponding
     to the predictions.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     # plot ROC curves for several cross-validation runs (dotted
     # in grey), overlaid by the vertical average curve and boxplots
     # showing the vertical spread around the average.
     data(ROCR.xval)
     pred <- prediction(ROCR.xval$predictions, ROCR.xval$labels)
     perf <- performance(pred,"tpr","fpr")
     plot(perf,col="grey82",lty=3)
     plot(perf,lwd=3,avg="vertical",spread.estimate="boxplot",add=TRUE)
