_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This is the main entry point for generating plots via the jjplot
     library.   It is called by specifying a data frame on which to
     operate, along with a formula which defines aesthetic mappings
     along with a tree of statistic and geometry commands.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     jjplot(f, data = NULL, color = NULL,
            fill = NULL, size = NULL, alpha = 1.0,
            log.x = FALSE, log.y = FALSE,
            xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
            expand = c(0.04, 0.04),
            color.scale = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       f: A formula specifying mappings for x and y aesthetics, as well
          as the statistic and geometry commands.  See details.  

    data: A data frame in whose scope the data expressions (i.e., 'f')
          should be evaluated.  

   color: The expression to map to the color aesthetic. 

    fill: The expression to map to the fill aesthetic. 

    size: The expression to map to the size aesthetic. 

   alpha: A constant numeric value with which to specify the alpha
          blending used on color and fill scales. 

   log.x: Use a logarithmic x scale. 

   log.y: Use a logarithmic y scale. 

    xlab: When specified, this overrides the default label for the x
          axis. 

    ylab: When specified, this overrides the default label for the y
          axis. 

  expand: A length-2 numeric vector.  The axes are guaranteed to
          contain the range of the data plus a fraction of the data
          range specified by this parameter.  The default simulates the
          default behavior of R's base plotting functions.  

color.scale: A function which maps values between 0 and 1 to colors. 
          If specified this color scale will override the default
          automatically generated color scale. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The formula is specified by placing the optional y aesthetic to
     the left of the '~' and the x aesthetic as  the first term
     (rightmost) of the formula.  Layers are subsequently evaluated
     from right to left, separated by '+'.  Parentheses are grouping
     operators for layers.  Statistics can be applied using the ':'
     operator, with the statistic on the right hand side and operations
     depending on the statistic on the left hand side.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The function is called only for its side effect (namely, a plot!).
