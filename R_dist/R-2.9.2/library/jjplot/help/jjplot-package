     jjplot is a plotting library inspired by ggplot2.  jjplot is
     written in grid and while not yet as functional as ggplot2, jjplot
     can quickly and easily produce beautiful graphics including line
     graphs, scatter plots, bar graphs, and boxplots.  jjplot also
     makes it straightfoward to compute and overlay statistics and fits
     onto graphs, and to facet graphs by factor via subplots and
     automatic color scales.
