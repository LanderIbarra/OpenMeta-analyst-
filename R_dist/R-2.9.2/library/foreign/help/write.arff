_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Writes data into Weka Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) files.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     write.arff(x, file, eol = "\n", relation = deparse(substitute(x)))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: the data to be written, preferably a matrix or data frame. If
          not, coercion to a data frame is attempted.

    file: either a character string naming a file, or a connection.
          '""' indicates output to the standard output connection.

     eol: the character(s) to print at the end of each line (row).

relation: The name of the relation to be written in the file.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'relation' will be passed through 'make.names' before writing to
     the file, in an attempt to it them acceptable to Weka, and column
     names what do not start with an alphabetic character will have 'X'
     prepended.

     However, the references say that ARFF files are ASCII files, and
     that encoding is not enforced.
