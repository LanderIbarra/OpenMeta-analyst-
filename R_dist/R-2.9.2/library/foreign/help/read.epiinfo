     Control and EpiData is a freely available data entry and
     validation system.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     read.epiinfo(file, read.deleted = FALSE, guess.broken.dates = FALSE,
                  thisyear = NULL, lower.case.names = FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    file: A filename, URL, or connection.

read.deleted: Deleted records are read if 'TRUE', omitted if 'FALSE' or
          replaced with 'NA' if 'NA'.

guess.broken.dates: Attempt to convert dates with 0 or 2 digit year
          information (see ‘Details’).

thisyear: A 4-digit year to use for dates with no year. Defaults to the
          current year.

lower.case.names: Convert variable names to lowercase?

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Epi Info allows dates to be specified with no year or with a 2 or
     4 digits.  Dates with four-digit years are always converted to
     'Date' class.  With the 'guess.broken.dates' option the function
     will attempt to convert two-digit years using the operating
     system's default method (see Date) and will use the current year
     or the 'thisyear' argument for dates with no year information.

     If 'read.deleted' is 'TRUE' the '"deleted"' attribute of the data
     frame indicates the deleted records.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A data frame.

_N_o_t_e:

     Epi Info 2000, the current version, uses the Microsoft Access file
     format to store data. This may be readable with the 'RODBC' or
     'RDCOM' packages.
