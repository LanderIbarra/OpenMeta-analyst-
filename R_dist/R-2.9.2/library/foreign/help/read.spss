     'read.spss' reads a file stored by the SPSS 'save' or 'export'
     commands.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     read.spss(file, use.value.labels = TRUE, to.data.frame = FALSE,
               max.value.labels = Inf, trim.factor.names = FALSE,
               trim_values = TRUE, reencode = NA, use.missings = to.data.frame)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    file: Character string: the name of the file or URL to read.

use.value.labels: Convert variables with value labels into R factors
          with those levels?

to.data.frame: return a data frame?

max.value.labels: Only variables with value labels and at most this
          many unique values will be converted to factors if
          'use.value.labels = TRUE'.

trim.factor.names: Logical: trim trailing spaces from factor levels?

trim_values: logical: should values and value labels have trailing
          spaces ignored when matching for 'use.value.labels = TRUE'?

reencode: logical: should character strings be re-encoded to the
          current locale.  The default, 'NA', means to do so in a UTF-8
          locale, only.  Alternatively character, specifying an
          encoding to assume.

use.missings: logical: should information on user-defined missing
          values be used to set the corresponding values to 'NA'?

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This uses modified code from the PSPP project (<URL:
     http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/> for reading the SPSS formats.

     If the filename appears to be a URL (of schemes 'http:', 'ftp:' or
     'https:') the URL is first downloaded to a temporary file and then
     read.  ('https:' is only supported on some platforms.)

     Occasionally in SPSS value labels will be added to some values of
     a continuous variable (e.g. to distinguish different types of
     missing data), and you will not want these variables converted to
     factors.  By setting 'max.val.labels' you can specify that
     variables with a large number of distinct values are not converted
     to factors even if they have value labels.  In addition, variables
     will not be converted to factors if there are non-missing values
     that have no value label. The value labels are then returned in
     the '"value.labels"' attribute of the variable.

     If SPSS variable labels are present, they are returned as the
     '"variable.labels"' attribute of the answer.

     Fixed length strings (including value labels) are padded on the
     right with spaces by SPSS, and so are read that way by R.  The
     default argument 'trim_values=TRUE' causes trailing spaces to be
     ignored when matching to value labels, as examples have been seen
     where the strings and the value labels had different amounts of
     padding.  See the examples for 'sub' for ways to remove trailing
     spaces in character data.

     provides a list of translations from Windows codepage numbers to
     encoding names that 'iconv' is likely to know about and so
     suitable values for 'reencode'.  Automatic re-encoding is
     attempted for apparent codepages of 200 or more in a UTF-8 locale:
     some other high-numbered codepages can be re-encoded on most
     systems, but the encoding names are platform-dependent (see
     'iconvlist'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list (or data frame) with one component for each variable in the
     saved data set.

     If what looks like a Windows codepage was recorded in the SPSS
     file, it is attached (as a number) as attribute '"codepage"' to
     the result.

     There may be attributes '"label.table"' and '"variable.labels"'. 
     Attribute '"label.table"' is a named list of value labels with one
     element per variable, either 'NULL' or a names character vector.
     Attribute '"variable.labels"' is a named character vector with
     names the short variable names and elements the long names.

     If there are user-defined missing values, there will be a
     attribute '"Missings"'.  This is a named list with one list
     element per variable.  Each element has an element 'type', a
     length-one character vector giving the type of missingness, and
     may also have an element 'value' with the values corresponding to
     missingness. This is a complex subject (where the R and C source
     code for 'read.spss') is the main documentation), but the simplest
     cases are types '"one"', '"two"' and '"three"' with a
     corresponding number of (real or string) values whose labels can
     be found from the '"label.table"' attribute.  Other possibilities
     are a finite or semi-infinite range, possibly plus a single value.

_N_o_t_e:

     If SPSS value labels are converted to factors the underlying
     numerical codes will not in general be the same as the SPSS
     numerical values, since the numerical codes in R are always
     1,2,3,....

     You may see warnings about the file encoding for SPSS 'save'
     files: it is possible such files contain non-ASCII character data
     which need re-encoding.  The most common occurrence is Windows
     codepage 1252, a superset of Latin-1.  The encoding is recorded
     (as an integer) in attribute '"codepage"' of the result if it
     looks like a Windows codepage.  Automatic re-encoding is done only
     in UTF-8 locales: see argument 'reencode'.
