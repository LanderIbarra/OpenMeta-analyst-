     The function reads a DBF file into a data frame, converting
     character fields to factors, and trying to respect NULL fields.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     read.dbf(file, as.is = FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    file: name of input file

   as.is: should character vectors not be converted to factors?

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     DBF is the extension used for files written for the ‘XBASE’ family
     of database languages, ‘covering the dBase, Clipper, FoxPro, and
     their Windows equivalents Visual dBase, Visual Objects, and Visual
     FoxPro, plus some older products’ (<URL:
     http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/>). Most of
     these follow the file structure used by Ashton-Tate's dBase II,
     III or 4 (later owned by Borland).

     'read.dbf' is based on C code from <URL:
     http://shapelib.maptools.org/> which implements the ‘XBASE’
     specification.  It can convert fields of type '"L"' (logical),
     '"N"' and '"F"' (numeric and float) and '"D"' (dates): all other
     field types are read as-is as character vectors.  A numeric field
     is read as an R integer vector if it is encoded to have no
     decimals, otherwise as a numeric vector.  However, if the numbers
     are too large to fit into an integer vector, it is changed to
     numeric.  Note that is possible to read integers that cannot be
     represented exactly even as doubles: this sometimes occurs if IDs
     are incorrectly coded as numeric.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A data frame of data from the DBF file; note that the field names
     are adjusted to use in R using 'make.names(unique=TRUE)'.

     There is an attribute '"data_type"' giving the single-character
     dBase types for each field.
