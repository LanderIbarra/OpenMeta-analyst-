_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plotting functions for SOM results.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     somgrid(xdim = 8, ydim = 6, topo = c("rectangular", "hexagonal"))

     ## S3 method for class 'somgrid':
     plot(x, type = "p", ...)

     ## S3 method for class 'SOM':
     plot(x, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

xdim, ydim: dimensions of the grid

    topo: the topology of the grid.

       x: an object inheriting from class '"somgrid"' or '"SOM"'.

type, ...: graphical parameters.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The class '"somgrid"' records the coordinates of the grid to be
     used for (batch or on-line) SOM: this has a plot method.

     The plot method for class '"SOM"' plots a 'stars' plot of the
     representative at each grid point.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     For 'somgrid', an object of class '"somgrid"', a list with
     components 

     pts: a two-column matrix giving locations for the grid points.

xdim, ydim, topo: as in the arguments to 'somgrid'.
