<h2>Regular Expressions as used in R</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This help page documents the regular expression patterns supported by
<code><a href="grep.html">grep</a></code> and related functions <code>regexpr</code>,
<code>gregexpr</code>, <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code>, as well as by
<code><a href="strsplit.html">strsplit</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
A &lsquo;regular expression&rsquo; is a pattern that describes a set of
strings.  Three types of regular expressions are used in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>,
<EM>extended</EM> regular expressions, used by
<code>grep(extended = TRUE)</code> (its default), <EM>basic</EM> regular
expressions, as used by <code>grep(extended = FALSE)</code>, and
<EM>Perl-like</EM> regular expressions used by <code>grep(perl = TRUE)</code>.
</p>
<p>
Other functions which use regular expressions (often via the use of
<code>grep</code>) include <code>apropos</code>, <code>browseEnv</code>,
<code>help.search</code>, <code>list.files</code>, <code>ls</code> and <code>strsplit</code>.
These will all use <EM>extended</EM> regular expressions, unless
<code>strsplit</code> is called with argument <code>extended = FALSE</code> or
<code>perl = TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>
Patterns are described here as they would be printed by <code>cat</code>:
<EM>do remember that backslashes need to be doubled when entering <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
character strings</EM>, e.g. from the keyboard.
</p>


<h3>Extended Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>
This section covers the regular expressions allowed if <code>extended
  = TRUE</code> in <code>grep</code>, <code>regexpr</code>, <code>gregexpr</code>, <code>sub</code>,
<code>gsub</code> and <code>strsplit</code>.  They use the <code>glibc</code> 2.7
implementation of the POSIX 1003.2 standard.
</p>
<p>
Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
</p>
<p>
The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and
digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any
metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with
a backslash.  (Escaping other characters with a backslash is
undefined in POSIX but gives the character in the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> implementation.)
The metacharacters in EREs are <span class="samp">. \ | ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ?</span>, but
note that whether these have a special meaning depends on the context.
</p>
<p>
A <EM>character class</EM> is a list of characters enclosed between
<span class="samp">[</span> and <span class="samp">]</span> which matches any single character in that list;
unless the first character of the list is the caret <span class="samp">^</span>, when it
matches any character <EM>not</EM> in the list.  For example, the
regular expression <span class="samp">[0123456789]</span> matches any single digit, and
<span class="samp">[^abc]</span> matches anything except the characters <span class="samp">a</span>,
<span class="samp">b</span> or <span class="samp">c</span>.  A range of characters may be specified by
giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen.  (Because
their interpretation is so locale-dependent, they are best avoided.)
</p>
<p>
The precise way character ranges are interpreted depends on the values
of <code>perl</code> and <code>ignore.case</code>.  For basic and extended regular
expressions the collation order is taken from the OS's
implementation of the setting of the locale category
<code>LC_COLLATE</code>, so <span class="samp">[W-Z]</span> may include <span class="samp">x</span> and if it
does may or may not include <span class="samp">w</span>.  (In most English locales the
collation order is <span class="samp">wWxXyYzZ</span>.)  For caseless matching the
characters in a range are interpreted as if in lower case, so in an
English locale <span class="samp">[W-z]</span> matches <span class="samp">WXYZwxyz</span>.  The only
portable way to specify all ASCII letters is to list them all as
character class,
<span class="samp">[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]</span>.
</p>
<p>
For Perl regexps, the ranges are interpreted in the numerical order of
the characters, either as bytes in a single-byte locale or as Unicode
points in a UTF-8 locale.  So in either case <span class="samp">[A-Za-z]</span> specifies
the set of ASCII letters.
</p>
<p>
Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Their
interpretation depends on the <EM>locale</EM> (see <a href="locales.html">locales</a>); the
interpretation below is that of the POSIX locale.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="samp">[:alnum:]</span></dt><dd>Alphanumeric characters: <span class="samp">[:alpha:]</span>
and <span class="samp">[:digit:]</span>.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:alpha:]</span></dt><dd>Alphabetic characters: <span class="samp">[:lower:]</span> and
<span class="samp">[:upper:]</span>.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:blank:]</span></dt><dd>Blank characters: space and tab.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:cntrl:]</span></dt><dd>Control characters.  In ASCII, these characters have octal codes
000 through 037, and 177 (<code>DEL</code>).  In another character set,
these are the equivalent characters, if any.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:digit:]</span></dt><dd>Digits: <span class="samp">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</span>.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:graph:]</span></dt><dd>Graphical characters: <span class="samp">[:alnum:]</span> and
<span class="samp">[:punct:]</span>.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:lower:]</span></dt><dd>Lower-case letters in the current locale.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:print:]</span></dt><dd>Printable characters: <span class="samp">[:alnum:]</span>, <span class="samp">[:punct:]</span> and space.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:punct:]</span></dt><dd>Punctuation characters:
<span class="samp">! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~</span>.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:space:]</span></dt><dd>Space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage
return, and space.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:upper:]</span></dt><dd>Upper-case letters in the current locale.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">[:xdigit:]</span></dt><dd>Hexadecimal digits:
<span class="samp">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f</span>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For example, <span class="samp">[[:alnum:]]</span> means <span class="samp">[0-9A-Za-z]</span>, except the
latter depends upon the locale and the character encoding, whereas
the former is independent of locale and character set.  (Note that the
brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must
be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket list.)
Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists.  To
include a literal <span class="samp">]</span>, place it first in the list.  Similarly, to
include a literal <span class="samp">^</span>, place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to
include a literal <span class="samp">-</span>, place it first or last (or, for
<code>perl = TRUE</code> only, precede it by a backslash.).  (Only these and
<span class="samp">\</span> remain special inside character classes.)
</p>
<p>
The period <span class="samp">.</span> matches any single character.  The symbol
<span class="samp">\w</span> is documented to be synonym for <span class="samp">[[:alnum:]]</span> and
<span class="samp">\W</span> is its negation.  However, <span class="samp">\w</span> also
matches underscore in the GNU grep code used in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
</p>
<p>
The caret <span class="samp">^</span> and the dollar sign <span class="samp">$</span> are metacharacters
that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
line.  The symbols <span class="samp">\&lt;</span> and <span class="samp">\&gt;</span> respectively match the
empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol <span class="samp">\b</span>
matches the empty string at either edge of a word, and <span class="samp">\B</span> matches
the empty string provided it is not at an edge of a word.
</p>
<p>
A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition
quantifiers:
<dl>
<dt><span class="samp">?</span></dt><dd>The preceding item is optional and will be matched
at most once.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">*</span></dt><dd>The preceding item will be matched zero or more
times.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">+</span></dt><dd>The preceding item will be matched one or more
times.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">{n}</span></dt><dd>The preceding item is matched exactly <code>n</code>
times.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">{n,}</span></dt><dd>The preceding item is matched <code>n</code> or more
times.</dd>


<dt><span class="samp">{n,m}</span></dt><dd>The preceding item is matched at least <code>n</code>
times, but not more than <code>m</code> times.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Repetition is greedy, so the maximal possible number of repeats is used.
</p>
<p>
Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.
</p>
<p>
Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator <span class="samp">|</span>;
the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
subexpression.   For example, <span class="samp">abba|cde</span> matches either the
string <code>abba</code> or the string <code>cde</code>.  Note that alternation
does not work inside character classes, where <span class="samp">|</span> has its literal
meaning.
</p>
<p>
Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules.
</p>
<p>
The backreference <span class="samp">\<VAR>N</VAR></span>, where <span class="samp"><VAR>N</VAR></span> is a single
digit, matches the substring previously matched by the Nth
parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression.
</p>


<h3>Basic Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>
This section covers the regular expressions allowed if <code>extended
  = FALSE</code> in <code>grep</code>, <code>regexpr</code>, <code>gregexpr</code>, <code>sub</code>,
<code>gsub</code> and <code>strsplit</code>.
</p>
<p>
In basic regular expressions the metacharacters <span class="samp">?</span>, <span class="samp">+</span>,
<span class="samp">{</span>, <span class="samp">|</span>, <span class="samp">(</span>, and <span class="samp">)</span> lose their special meaning;
instead use the backslashed versions <span class="samp">\?</span>, <span class="samp">\+</span>,
<span class="samp">\ {</span>, <span class="samp">\|</span>, <span class="samp">\(</span>, and <span class="samp">\)</span>.  Thus the
metacharacters are <span class="samp">. \ [ ^ $ *</span>.
</p>


<h3>Perl Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>
The <code>perl = TRUE</code> argument to <code>grep</code>, <code>regexpr</code>,
<code>gregexpr</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>gsub</code> and <code>strsplit</code> switches
to the PCRE library that &lsquo;implements regular expression pattern
matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5.6 or later,
with just a few differences&rsquo;.  It adds some features from Perl 5.10.
</p>
<p>
For complete details please consult the man pages for PCRE, especially
<CODE>man pcrepattern</CODE> and <CODE>man pcreapi</CODE>), on your system or from
the sources at <a href="http://www.pcre.org">http://www.pcre.org</a>. If PCRE support was compiled
from the sources within <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, the PCRE version is 7.8 as described here
(version <i>&gt;=</i> 7.6 is required if <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> is configured to use the
system's PCRE library).
</p>
<p>
Perl regular expressions are computed byte-by-byte rather than
character-by-character except in UTF-8 locales.  Since the only
non-UTF-8 multibyte locales in common use are those for CJK languages,
they should be used with care in non-UTF-8 CJK locales.
</p>
<p>
All the regular expressions described for extended regular expressions
are accepted except <span class="samp">\&lt;</span> and <span class="samp">\&gt;</span>: in Perl all backslashed
metacharacters are alphanumeric and backslashed symbols always are
interpreted as a literal character. <span class="samp">{</span> is not special if it would
be the start of an invalid interval specification.  There can be more than
9 backreferences.  In a UTF-8 locale the named character classes only
match ASCII characters: see <span class="samp">\p</span> below for an alternative.
</p>
<p>
The construct <span class="samp">(?...)</span> is used for Perl extensions in a variety
of ways depending on what immediately follows the <span class="samp">?</span>.
</p>
<p>
Perl-like matching can work in several modes, set by the options
<span class="samp">(?i)</span> (caseless, equivalent to Perl's <span class="samp">/i</span>), <span class="samp">(?m)</span>
(multiline, equivalent to Perl's <span class="samp">/m</span>), <span class="samp">(?s)</span> (single line,
so a dot matches all characters, even new lines: equivalent to Perl's
<span class="samp">/s</span>) and <span class="samp">(?x)</span> (extended, whitespace data characters are
ignored unless escaped and comments are allowed: equivalent to Perl's
<span class="samp">/x</span>).  These can be concatenated, so for example, <span class="samp">(?im)</span>
sets caseless multiline matching.  It is also possible to unset these
options by preceding the letter with a hyphen, and to combine setting
and unsetting such as <span class="samp">(?im-sx)</span>.  These settings can be applied
within patterns, and then apply to the remainder of the pattern.
Additional options not in Perl include <span class="samp">(?U)</span> to set
&lsquo;ungreedy&rsquo; mode (so matching is minimal unless <span class="samp">?</span> is used,
when it is greedy).  Initially none of these options are set.
</p>
<p>
If you want to remove the special meaning from a sequence of
characters, you can do so by putting them between <span class="samp">\Q</span> and
<span class="samp">\E</span>. This is different from Perl in that <span class="samp">$</span> and <span class="samp">@</span> are
handled as literals in <span class="samp">\Q...\E</span> sequences in PCRE, whereas in
Perl, <span class="samp">$</span> and <span class="samp">@</span> cause variable interpolation.
</p>
<p>
The escape sequences <span class="samp">\d</span>, <span class="samp">\s</span> and <span class="samp">\w</span> represent any
decimal digit, space character and &lsquo;word&rsquo; character
(letter, digit or underscore in the current locale, except that in a
UTF-8 locale only ASCII letters are considered) respectively, and
their upper-case versions represent their negation.  Unlike POSIX and
earlier versions of Perl and PCRE, vertical tab is not regarded as a
whitespace character.
</p>
<p>
Escape sequence <span class="samp">\a</span> is <span class="samp">BEL</span>, <span class="samp">\e</span> is <span class="samp">ESC</span>,
<span class="samp">\f</span> is <span class="samp">FF</span>, <span class="samp">\n</span> is <span class="samp">LF</span>, <span class="samp">\r</span> is
<span class="samp">CR</span> and <span class="samp">\t</span> is <span class="samp">TAB</span>.  In addition <span class="samp">\c<VAR>x</VAR></span>
is <span class="samp">cntrl-<VAR>x</VAR></span> for any <span class="samp"><VAR>x</VAR></span>, <span class="samp">\<VAR>ddd</VAR></span> is
the octal character <span class="samp"><VAR>ddd</VAR></span> (for up to three digits unless
interpretable as a backreference, as <span class="samp">\1</span> to <span class="samp">\7</span> always
are), and <span class="samp">\x<VAR>hh</VAR></span> specifies a character by two hex digits.
In a UTF-8 locale, <span class="samp">\x{<VAR>h...</VAR>}</span> specifies a Unicode point
by one or more hex digits.
</p>
<p>
Outside a character class, <span class="samp">\b</span> matches a word boundary,
<span class="samp">\B</span> is its negation, <span class="samp">\A</span> matches at start of a subject (even
in multiline mode, unlike <span class="samp">^</span>), <span class="samp">\Z</span> matches at end of a
subject or before newline at end, <span class="samp">\z</span> matches at end of a
subject. and <span class="samp">\G</span> matches at first matching position in a
subject (which is subtly different from Perl's end of the previous
match).  <span class="samp">\C</span> matches a single byte. including a newline.
In a UTF-8 locale, <span class="samp">\R</span> matches any Unicode newline character
(not just CR), and <span class="samp">\X</span> matches any number of Unicode characters
that form an extended Unicode sequence.
</p>
<p>
In a UTF-8 locale, some Unicode properties are supported via
<span class="samp">\p{<VAR>xx</VAR>}</span> and <span class="samp">\P{<VAR>xx</VAR>}</span> which match
characters with and without property <span class="samp"><VAR>xx</VAR></span> respectively.
For a list of supported properties see the PCRE documentation, but for
example <span class="samp">Lu</span> is &lsquo;upper case letter&rsquo; and <span class="samp">Sc</span> is
&lsquo;currency symbol&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
The same repetition quantifiers as extended POSIX are supported.
However, if a quantifier is followed by <span class="samp">?</span>, the match is
&lsquo;ungreedy&rsquo;, that is as short as possible rather than as long as
possible (unless the meanings are reversed by the <span class="samp">(?U)</span> option.)
</p>
<p>
The sequence <span class="samp">(?#</span> marks the start of a comment which continues
up to the next closing parenthesis.  Nested parentheses are not
permitted.  The characters that make up a comment play no part at all in
the pattern matching.
</p>
<p>
If the extended option is set, an unescaped <span class="samp">#</span> character outside
a character class introduces a comment that continues up to the next
newline character in the pattern.
</p>
<p>
The pattern <span class="samp">(?:...)</span> groups characters just as parentheses do
but does not make a backreference.
</p>
<p>
Patterns <span class="samp">(?=...)</span> and <span class="samp">(?!...)</span> are zero-width positive and
negative lookahead <EM>assertions</EM>: they match if an attempt to
match the <code>...</code> forward from the current position would succeed
(or not), but use up no characters in the string being processed.
Patterns <span class="samp">(?&lt;=...)</span> and <span class="samp">(?&lt;!...)</span> are the lookbehind
equivalents: they do not allow repetition quantifiers nor <span class="samp">\C</span>
in <code>...</code>.
</p>
<p>
Named subpatterns, atomic grouping, possessive qualifiers and conditional
and recursive patterns are not covered here.
