<h2><a name="top">Fixed-Effect and Random-Effects Models</a></h2>
 <p>There are two basic types of models used in meta-analysis: fixed-effect models and random-effects models:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Fixed-effect model - Assume that all studies in the meta-analysis share a common (true) effect size. The only source of uncertainty is the within-study (sampling) error.
          The fixed-effect model can be written as<br>
          <eq><img src="images/fixed_effect_model.png"></eq><br>
          where y<sub><em>i</em></sub> is the observed effect in study <em>i</em>, &theta; is the true effect size, and <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> is the within-study variance (or sampling error) in study <em>i</em>. 
     </li>
     <li>Random-effects model - Assume that each study has its own true effect size, which may differ between studies. Sources of uncertainty include both within-study errors and between-study variance - the variance of the true effect sizes. The between-study variance is also known as the <em>heterogeneity</em> of the model.<br><br>
           The random-effects model can be written as<br>
           <eq><img src="images/random_effects_model.png"></eq><br> 
     where
     <ul>
         <li>&mu; is the grand (overall) mean</li>
         <li>&alpha;<sub><em>i</em></sub> is the between-study variance - the difference between the true effect in study <em>i</em> and the grand mean</li>
         <li><em>v<sub>i</sub></em> is the within-study variance in study <em>i</em>.</li>
     </ul>
</ul>

 <p>The next two sections describe methods for estimating the summary effect sizes in both the fixed and random-effects cases.</p>
