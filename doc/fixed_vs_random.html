<h2><a name="top">Fixed-Effect Versus Random-Effects Models</a></h2>
 <p>There are two fundamental types of models used in meta-analysis: fixed-effect models and random-effects models. The main differences between the two are summarized below:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>In the fixed-effect model, we assume that all studies in the meta-analysis share a common (true) effect size. The only source of uncertainty is the within-study (sampling) error.
          The fixed-effect model can be written as<br>
          <eq><img src="images/fixed_effect_model.png"></eq><br>
          where y<sub><em>i</em></sub> is the observed effect in study <em>i</em>, &theta; is the true effect size, and <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> is the within-study variance (or sampling error) in study <em>i</em>. 
     </li>
     <li>In the random-effects model, we assume that each study has its own true effect size, which may differ between studies. Sources of uncertainty include both within-study errors and between-study variance - the variance of the true effect sizes. The between-study variance is also known as the <em>heterogeneity</em> of the model.<br><br>
           The random-effects model can be written as<br>
           <eq><img src="images/random_effects_model.png"></eq><br> 
     where &mu; is the grand (overall) mean,  &alpha;<sub><em>i</em></sub> is the difference between the true effect in study <em>i</em> and the grand mean, and <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> is the within-study error in study <em>i</em>.</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Fixed-Effect Methods</h3>
<p>There are a variety of methods for estimating the summary effect size in a fixed-effect model. One such method is the <em>inverse-variance</em> method. In this method, the summary effect Y is computed as a weighted sum of individual study effects, where the weights are proportional to the inverse of the study variance. That is,</p>
 <eq><img src="images/inv_var_weighted_sum.png"></eq> 
 <p>where <em>w<sub>i</sub></em> = 1 / <em>v<sub>i</sub></em>. The sum in the denominator is included to make the sum of the weights equal to 1.</p>
 <h3>Random-Effect Methods</h3>
<p>In the random effects model, one can still estimate the summary effect size as an inverse-variance weighted sum. However, in this case, the
variance for each study is the sum of the within-study variance, &epsilon;<sub><em>i</em></sub>, plus the between-study variance.  The first of these is known from the data, but the between study variance - the heterogeneity, which is usually denoted by &tau;<sup>2</sup> - must be estimated. There are many methods for estimating the heterogeneity of the data, such as the DerSimonian Laird method.</p>
<p>Note that the random-effects weights are proportional to</p>
<eq><img src="images/random_effects_variance.png"></eq><br>
<p>So the ratio of the weights for studies <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> is</p>
<eq><img src="images/ratio_of_weights.png"></eq><br>
<p>When the heterogeneity &tau;<sup>2</sup> is large compared to the within-study variances, the ratio of weights is approximately 1 - so the weights of studies <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are approximately equal. In other words, in the random-effects estimate for the summary effect, all studies have approximately the same weight.</p>
