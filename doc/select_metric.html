 <h2><a name="specify_metric">Changing the Metric for the Effect Size</a></h2>
<p>For two-arm studies with binary data, as shown in the preceding example, the default metric for the effect size is the odds ratio (OR). To change 
  the metric:
  <ol>
  <li>Select <b>metric</b> in the <b>Analysis</b> menu.</li>
  <li>Select <b>two-arm</b> or <b>one-arm</b>. </li>
  <li>Select a metric from the pop-up 
  menu, as shown below.</p>

   <p>When you select a metric, the effect 
  sizes and confidence intervals in the data table are immediately updated. </p>  
  
   <p><b>Note:</b> If you select a one-arm metric, the metric is only applied to the data columns labeled Tx An and Tx AN. 
   The Tx Bn and Tx BN columns are shaded grey, as shown below. When you run an analysis, only the data in the
   Tx An and Tx AN columns are included.</p>
