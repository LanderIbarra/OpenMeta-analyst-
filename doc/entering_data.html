<h2>Entering Data</a></h2>  
  <p>You can enter data in Open Meta-Analyst in either of the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Type the data directly into the fields in the Open Meta-Analyst window.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste data from an existing spreadsheet, such as an Excel.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have already entered the data into a spreadsheet, copying and pasting is the easiest method. Otherwise, you can enter data directly as follows:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Click the study name field and type a name for the first study. As an option, you can also add the year of the study.</li>
  <li>Enter data in the fields to the right of "year". For binary data, the fields are:
  <ul>
    <li>tx An - The number of events in the treatment group.</li>
    <li>tx AN - The number of subjects in the treatment group.</li>
    <li>tx Bn - The number of events in the control group. </li>
    <li>tx BN - The number of subjects in the control group.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>An example is shown below:</p>

  </ol>

 <p>The yellow fields to the right of the data display the following:</p>
	<ul> 
	  <li>OR - The effect size - By default, the odds ratio is displayed.</li>
  	  <li>lower -  The lower bound of the confidence interval  at a 95% confidence level</li>
  	  <li>upper -  The upper bound of the confidence interval at a 95% confidence level</li>
   </ul>
